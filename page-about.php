          <p>All of my ministry has been served in the Dioceses of Chichester and Winchester. Most recently, I served as Vicar of All Saints Findon Valley with St Peter’s High Salvington for over 12 years. 
  I have been an Associate of an Anglican religious order, The Community of the Servants of the Will of God based at Crawley Down, West Sussex, for 30 years. I have now been Parish Priest here for 16 months, and am putting into practice our Parish Profile vision: ‘Attending to God’, ‘Building Christian Community’ and ‘Commending God’s Love to the World’. I pray that people viewing this site will capture the vision and join our Church community.

          <p>My family moved to Hamble in 1981 for my husband, Colin, to run a fruit and vegetable shop at Coronation Parade - he had just retired from teaching. We have loved living in the village and here we found St. Andrew’s Church which has become a home from home for us over the years.  In 1987 I was licensed by the Bishop of Winchester to be a  "Reader"– recently re-named "Licensed Lay Minister"  which is easier to understand!  (I had a degree in theology and undertook further training).  I am licensed to preach and teach and carry out other duties - including conducting funerals and taking out communion to the housebound which is part of my ministry which I most love.</p>

          <p>My wife and I moved to Hamble in 1980. I am an orthodox Anglo Catholic with my faith firmly rooted in the integrity of scripture. I have enjoyed many roles at St. Andrew’s and have in the past served at the high altar, held the post of sacristan as well as that of Licensed Lay Minister. I have also served as a volunteer to the Chaplaincy at the Southampton General Hospital, a role I wish to devote more time to in the future as well as my duties as Licensed Lay Minister at St. Andrew’s.</p>

          <p>I came to Hamble from London at the outbreak of World War 2 and grew up in the village.  I went to the local schools and on leaving went to sea with Cunard.  In the 1950’s, I came ashore and set up various successful business ventures.  In 1958 I moved back to Hamble and purchased the Old Vicarage and from this I became involved with St Andrew’s along with my wife Heather.  I organised many fundraising events for local charities and the church, and recently my efforts were rewarded with the National Churchill Award for charity work. This is my second spell as Churchwarden and I continueto work hard to keep the church at the centre of our community.</p>

          <p>St. Andrew’s has been a part of my life for the past 44 years. My daughter was baptised and confirmed here and, my husband Roy and I had a Marriage Blessing and Nuptial Mass nearly 30 years ago. I have been privileged to serve the church in different guises over the years including: sidesperson, Sunday school teacher, youth leader, churchwarden, PCC member and in the choir.

          Music is a very important part of our worship at St Andrew’s and valued by the congregation.  The choir practices on Thursday evenings and welcomes men, women and teenagers. It leads the congregational singing on Sunday mornings and at special services throughout the year. We sing traditional and modern anthems and worship songs and aim to provide “something for everyone”!

The various roles have special names : eg “Crucifer” carries the cross in processions, “Thurifer” handles the incense and the “Acolytes” carry the candles. New servers are welcome and will be given training.  For more information contact Fr Graham Whiting; <a class="phone-number" href="tel:023 8045 2148">023 8045 2148</a>.

In addition, we are introducing alternative forms of worship and activities to grow our church and share God’s love more widely with the people of Hamble and further afield.

           1109 that monks came from near Chartres in France led by St Bernard of Thiron (later of Cluny) and founded an abbey and priory church in Hamble. It has been a place of worship ever since and is now renowned as one of the most archaeologically and historically interesting medieval churches in Hamp-shire.  It contains fine examples of Norman architecture and fascinating memorials as well as a wealth of 19th century stained glass.

          Some splendid features have been added in recent years.  A glorious new stained glass west window was installed in 2001 depicting our founder St. Bernard against a delightful view of the Hamble River with the Isle of Wight beyond.  Major restoration works have also been undertaken, including a new roof, stonework around the windows and several of the stained glass windows themselves have been repaired. The church is now in an excellent state of repair considering its age.
