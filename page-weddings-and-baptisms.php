		<h2>Weddings</h2>
		<p>
			A church wedding is one of life’s great moments when, in the presence of God, two people declare their love and commitment to each other by making vows, giving and receiving rings and signing the marriage registers. The attractiveness of our 900 year old church building and beautiful churchyard makes it a popular choice for weddings, with the option of booking the Priory Centre for receptions.<br> <a href="/community/#priory-centre">Priory Centre &rarr;</a>

		To be married at St Andrew’s Church requires a link with the parish either through residency or family connections in the past.  If neither of these apply one would have to commit to attending the church on a regular basis until the wedding.

		All enquiries about weddings at St Andrew’s Church should be made to our Parish Priest, Fr Graham Whiting: <a class="phone-number" href="tel:02380452148">023 8045 2148</a>|<a class="email-address" href="mailto:grahamwhiting@yahoo.com">grahamwhiting@yahoo.com</a>

		<h2>Baptisms</h2>
		<p>
			Baptism for babies and children takes place in a service often called a Christening. In this service parents thank God for the gift of life, make a decision to start their child on a journey of faith and godparents promise to help and support. Those who are baptised are welcomed into the wider church family and prayers are said for parents and Godparents.
			Adults can also be baptised.
